          comment: "Completed testing of the Settings modal functionality. The modal opens correctly when clicking the Settings button in the header. Tab navigation works properly - successfully switched between all four tabs (Appearance, Layout, Preferences, Achievements) and verified that each tab's content loads correctly. Theme switching in the Appearance tab works as expected - successfully applied the Ocean theme and verified the CSS custom properties were updated. Layout density changes in the Layout tab also work correctly - successfully changed to Compact layout. The modal has proper z-index and appears above all other content. However, there are issues with the modal closing functionality. The X button in the top-right corner, clicking outside the modal, and pressing the Escape key all fail to close the modal. This is a critical issue that needs to be fixed. Additionally, language switching within the modal has issues - while the language dropdown is visible in the Preferences tab, changing the language doesn't update the modal content properly. Overall, the Settings modal has good content interaction but critical issues with closing functionality that need to be addressed."
